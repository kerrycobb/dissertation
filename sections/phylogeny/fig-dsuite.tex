  $f$-branch statistics

  \footnotesize 
  Heatmap showing to the value of the $f$-branch statistic computed for 
  all pairs possible pairs of \anaxyrus species. 
  The $f$-branch statistic indicates the proportion of excess allele sharing  
  between a species on the x-axis and branch on the y-axis (relative to its sister branch).
  Excess allele sharing between species identifies possible gene flow beteen them.
  Grey boxes indicate that the given tips cannot be tested by Dsuite for the 
  given tree toplogy.
