  $f$-branch statistics 
}{
  \footnotesize 
  Heatmap showing the value of the $f$-branch statistic computed for 
  each possible pair of \anaxyrus species. 
  The $f$-branch statistic indicates the proportion of excess allele sharing  
  between a species on the x-axis and branch on the y-axis (relative to its sister branch).
  Excess allele sharing between species indicates possible gene flow between them.
  Grey boxes indicate that pairs cannot be tested by Dsuite for the 
  given tree toplogy.
