  Evanno method for optimal value of K among \amer \structure analyses \parencite{evanno2005}. 
  The following caption applies to all Evanno figures that follow.
  $K$ refers to the number of populations for each of the different \structure models examined. 
  (A) Mean estimated $\ln$ probability of data over 10 runs for each value 
  of $K$. 
  (B) Rate of change of the likelihood distribution 
  (C) Mean absolute values of the second order rate of change of the likelihood distribution (mean $\pm SD$)
  (D) The rate of change of the likelihood of data beween successive K values ($\Delta K$). 
  The modal value of this distribution is considered the true
  value of $K$ for the data. 
  Plot created using \pophelper \parencite{francis2017}.
