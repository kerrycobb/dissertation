  Evanno method for optimal value for K in \structure \parencite{evanno2005}. 
  $K$ refers to the number of populations for each of the different \structure models examined. 
  (A) Mean estimated $\ln$ probability of data over 10 iterations for each value 
  of $K \pm SD$. 
  (B) Rate of change of the likelihood distribution (mean $\pm SD$) 
  (C) Absolute values of the second order rate of change of the likelihood distribution (mean $\pm SD$)
  (D) $\Delta K$. The modal value of this distribution is considered the true
  value of $K$ for the data.
