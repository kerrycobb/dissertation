  Genetic evidence of hybridization between \amer and \terr. 
  (A) Bar plot with the ancestry coefficients estimated with \structure.  
  (B) Summary of poulation genetic structure based on the principal component axes
  one (PC1) and two (PC2). These axes explain 10.5\% (PC1) and 3.1\% (PC2) of the genetic variation 
  among individuals.
  (C) Relationship between the first principal component axis and the admixture 
  proportions estimated with \structure.
  (D) Sample map showing the sampling location and estimated ancestry coefficients 
  of each sample. The inset map shows the approximate ranges of each species and 
  the study area highlighted in red.
