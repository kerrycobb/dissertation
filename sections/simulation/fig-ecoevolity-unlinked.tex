  \footnotesize The performance of \ecoevolity with data sets simulated with
  unlinked characters.
  Each plotted circle and associated error bars represent the posterior mean and
  95\% credible interval.
  Circles and error bars are colored yellow if the effective sample size (ESS) of
  the estimate was less than 200, red if the potential scale reduction factor
  (PSRF) was greater than 1.2, and green if both conditions were true.
  The root mean square error (RMSE) and rate of poor MCMC behavior (RPMB) is
  given for each plot, the latter of which is the proportion of estimates with
  ESS < 200 and/or PSRF > 1.2.
  Inset plots magnify estimates of most recent divergence times.
  We generated the plots using matplotlib Version 3.1.1 \parencite{matplotlib}.
