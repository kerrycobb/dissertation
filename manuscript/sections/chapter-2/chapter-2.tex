  Simulation model
}{
  \footnotesize An illsustration of the species-tree model we used to simulate
  data. \rootpopsize, \tippopsize[1], and \tippopsize[2] represent the constant 
  effective population sizes of the root, and each of the two terminal populations.
  \divtime reperesents the instantaneous separation of the ancestral population into
  two descendant populations. One hypothetical gene tree is shown to illustrate the 
  gene trees simulated under a contained coalescent process for 4 haploid gene 
  copies sampled from each of the terminal branches of the species tree.
